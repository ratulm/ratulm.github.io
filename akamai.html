&nbsp;
<br>Here are my conjectures on how Akamai works. These are based on some
experiments done on April 4th, 2000 using mainly "dig". These were conducted
from some machines at UW and one at MIT.
<h3>
1. What an Akamaized page looks like?</h3>
Suppose you enter www.cnn.com in your browser. This fetches the index.html
file from the cnn server. In that file there will be images which will
be pointing to the Akamai servers. Those URLs look like
<p><a href="http://a388.g.akamaitech.net/7/388/21/fc35ed7f236388/cnn.com/images/hub2000/ad.info.gif">http://a388.g.akamaitech.net/7/388/21/fc35ed7f236388/cnn.com/images/hub2000/ad.info.gif</a>
<br><a href="http://a1380.g.akamaitech.net/7/1380/175/03202000/www1.jcpenney.com/images/homepagev4/homepage/catalog.gif">http://a1380.g.akamaitech.net/7/1380/175/03202000/www1.jcpenney.com/images/homepagev4/homepage/catalog.gif</a>
<br><a href="http://a620.g.akamai.net/7/620/16/259fdbf4ed29de/www.computer.com/images/learn_more_off.gif">http://a620.g.akamai.net/7/620/16/259fdbf4ed29de/www.computer.com/images/learn_more_off.gif</a>
<br>&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>
The number after "a", I think, identifies the customer. So 388 is cnn,
1380 is jcpenny and 620 is computer.com. Note that it is crucial to have
different machine name for each customer as will become clear later.</li>

<li>
I am not sure what 7 stands for but it was present in almost of the Akamaized
URLs I saw.</li>

<li>
Next is again the customer identifier.</li>

<li>
What the following&nbsp; two identifiers (21 and&nbsp; fade2068e7503e for
cnn) represent is not fully clear. A plausible explanation (courtesy <a href="mailto:cardwell@cs.washington.edu">Neal
Cardwell</a>) is&nbsp; that the 14 digit hex strings are checksums of the
content that path refers to. That way the name always changes if the content
changes so the akamai caches at the edge don't have to worry about consistency
or freshness.</li>

<br><b>* update </b>(courtesy <a href="mailto:jsjacob@iamnota.com">John
Jacob</a>): The hex string is created using "md5sum [file_name] |&nbsp;
cut -c3-16". It can also be replaced by a cache time-to -live value like
"1d" for one day,&nbsp; and "15m" for 15 mins.
<li>
Next is the customer url itself. The path after that is identical to the
path on the customer machine. So the above jcpenny URL and "<a href="http://www1.jcpenney.com/images/homepagev4/homepage/catalog.gif">www1.jcpenney.com/images/homepagev4/homepage/catalog.gif</a>"
lead to the same gif.</li>
</ul>
Getting a web site in the above form is not too tough either. Akamai has
a simple tool, Free Flow Launcher, for its customers that they use to Akamaize
their pages. The users will specify what content they want to be served
through Akamai and the tool will go ahead and Akamaize the URLs. This way
the customers still have complete control of what gets served through Akamai
and what they still are in charge of. Typicall all the dynamic content
and stuff like transactions and cookies are taken by of by the customer's
server only. Now the customer is responsible only for the content he choses
to server himself and first few hits of other content till the Akamai caches
warm up.
<h3>
2. DNS Black Magic</h3>
I do not know the DNS system inside out, so the information here could
be incomplete or simply wrong. Believe it at your own risk. Below is the
chronology of steps that happen when an object from an Akamai server is
to be fetched.
<h4>
Step 1</h4>
From the top level domain you first get the name server of akamaitech.net
domain. Interesting things happen here itself. There are 8 name servers
reported z[A-H].akamaitech.net&nbsp; This information obtained is good
on the scale of days.
<p>Below is part of "dig" output.
<br>The columns are &lt;Machine-Name> &lt;Lifetime of cached information>
&lt;IN (for query-type)> &lt;A (for query-class)> &lt;IP Address.
<br>(There is no need to worry about the query type and query class here.)

<p>A couple of points are of interest here.
<ul>
<li>
The machines at MIT and UW see different information. This could be because
they access different NET name servers.</li>

<li>
Another interesting observation here is that IP addresses in the two outputs
are more or less (one exception) permutation of each other. What is achieved
by having a different IP address for different names is not clear to me.
But having the IP addresses returned in different order might achieve load
balancing.</li>
</ul>

<h4>
Step 2</h4>
From one of the name servers above you go and get the name servers for
domain g.akamaitech.net. Now this step is where most of the stuff happens.
A few observations about the information returned at this step.
<ul>
<li>
&nbsp;The name servers are n[0-9]g.akamaitech.net.</li>

<li>
This information can be cached from 30mins to 1hour.</li>

<li>
The IP addresses of name servers returned are different for different client
locations (IP addresses).</li>

<li>
The set of name server IPs returned to a particular client changes with
time.&nbsp; So if you access cnn.com at different times (separated by DNS
cache expiry) you could be contacting different name servers and thus downloading
objects from different servers.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that all the IP addresses are not unique in a set. My take is that
this makes future expansions easier with changed restricted to lesser places.
<p>My belief is that this is THE step where all the Akamai DNS magic is.
It will hand out different set of name server IPs to client contacting
from different IP addresses. How it determines the nearest set of servers
from IP addresses is anybody's guess (proprietary, but allegedly, they
use&nbsp;BGP peering with ISPs that host the Akamai cluster, thus giving
them a rough estimate of the distance of requesting user from that site
- courtesy <a href="mailto:tommy@almestien.com">Tommy Larsen</a>). Apart
from wire latency other factors they claim to consider are load on their
servers and Internet congestion. They also claim to be able to monitor
their servers in real time (once per second). This means that gives out
different sets of name server IPs at different times, which explains the
short lifetime (30mins - 1hour) of this information. For instance following
is part of dig output from the same UW machine at different times (or even
different machines at same time - see below).

<p>This has another nice (for Akamai load balancing), or not so nice (for
things like organization wide caches) side effect. Different machines could
be downloading the same object from different Akamai servers at the same
time, if&nbsp; those machines connect to different primary name servers
within in the department (like our setup at UW-CSE).
<h4>
Step 3</h4>
In the final step you go to one of the n[09]g.akamaitech.net name server
and get the IP address of the machine you are looking for (e.g.:&nbsp;
a388.g.akamaitech.net). The server will return two IP addresses for each
machine name. For instance, see the partial dig output below
<p>a1388.g.akamaitech.net.&nbsp; 20S IN A&nbsp; 216.52.232.134
<br>a1388.g.akamaitech.net.&nbsp; 20S IN A&nbsp; 216.52.232.149
<p>Observe that the lifetime of this information is a mere 20 seconds (which
corresponds to one or two web pages viewed) . So after this time period
you will go back to the Akamai name server to get the IP addresses.&nbsp;
What this means is that even if both the machines go down, it is highly
unlikely that this will be seen by the client.&nbsp; (assuming that the
Akamai name servers find this out and return a different IP in a failure
scenario).
<p>It is likely that all the machines don't host the content of all the
customers. Suppose that there are three servers (three different machines)
- A,B and C at a particular site (a site will typically have multiple machines).
And the customers are X, Y and Z. So A will host X,Y, B will host Y,Z and
C will host Z,X. This kind of an arrangement has a two-fold advantage
<br>1) No server has to host all the customers' content. Easing the load
on it and also making the content serving faster.
<br>2) If any one server goes down, no customer is fully disconnected as
there is another server (potentially more) with its tree.
<p>A customer's content could be present at more than two servers at a
site, but it makes sense to return the same two machines (till they are
up) because of file caching, the object does not have to retrieved from
the disk most of the times.
<p>Another observed feature is that all the name servers in the set (n[0-9]g.akamaitech.net)
returned in above step, give the same two IP addresses for a queried server
(like a1388.g.akamaitech.net). This could mean that the configuration of
all the servers in a set is identical and multiple servers are there just
for sharing the load.

<hr WIDTH="100%">
<br><u>Akamai caches</u> (courtesy <a href="mailto:cardwell@cs.washington.edu">Neal
Cardwell</a>)
<br>The akamai machines at the edge are PCs running Linux and a slightly
modified version of the squid cache. They are doing on-demand caching rather
than push-based replication.
<p><u>Name server differences</u>
<br>An artifact of the above exploration is the observation that different
versions of named&nbsp; might be running in the department (@UW-CSE).
<br>While 128.95.4.1 (bs4) always returns the two IP addresses in different
order (to get some sort of load balancing), 128.95.1.6 (bs1) does no such
thing.
<br>And the one at MIT (18.26.0.36) seems to be returning the IP addresses
in a random order.<a href="http://attendeeassistant.com/new/site/3/FF_White_Paper-non%20NDA_4_20003.pdf"></a>
