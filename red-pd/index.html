RED-PD: RED with Preferential Dropping</h2></center>

<p><b><i>Abstract</i></b>
<br>FIFO queueing is simple but does not protect traffic from flows that
send more than their share or flows that fail to use end-to-end congestion
control. At the other extreme, per-flow scheduling mechanisms provide max-min
fairness but are more complex, keeping state for all flows going through
the router. This paper proposes RED-PD (RED with Preferential Dropping),
a flow-based mechanism that combines simplicity and protection by keeping
state for just the high-bandwidth flows. RED-PD uses the packet drop history
at the router to detect high-bandwidth flows in times of congestion and
preferentially drop packets from these flows. This paper discusses the
design decisions underlying RED-PD, and presents simulations evaluating
RED-PD in a range of environments.

<p><b>Simulation Scripts (<a href="http://www.isi.edu/nsnam">ns</a>)</b>
<br>The&nbsp; simulation scripts of RED-PD can be found in the ns distribution
in the directory ~ns/tcl/ex/red-pd. The <a href="README.txt">README</a>
file in that directory contains the instruction for running the simulations.
The validation tests for red-pd are in ~ns/tcl/test/test-suite-red-pd.tcl.
